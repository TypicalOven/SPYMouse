# SPY Mouse
This is an archive of 2011 mobile game "SPY Mouse." 

A casual and strategy path-drawing styled game that is rather unique compared to other mobile games. 

This is simply just an archive of the game and to ensure that it won't turn into lost media if something goes wrong.

Special Thanks to TelephoneActive1539 for archiving this game.

## Files and What They Do
The ".apk" file is a launcher that loads the game files and therefore brings you to the game.

The "ANDROID Files" Folder is the aforementioned "Game Files" that are being loaded by the launcher.

## How To Play
Head over to the HowToPlay.md file and follow the steps given.

## Take Note
- That the game will not work on newer Devices, since this game is built on code that's as old as 2011.
- That I am not a SPY Mouse Developer, Curator, or Contributor to SPY Mouse in any way, shape or form.
- That you should not hold myself accountable for when something goes wrong with your installation.
- That I am not an experienced programmer or hasn't dabbled quite much in coding in general yet. (Maybe soon I will start learning)
